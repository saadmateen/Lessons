# Lesson 7: Debugging and Intro to NLP

This will be the final Coffee N Code lesson for this term. Today I'll be going around helping everyone debug the cyberbullying detection engine they built so they can run it on their computer. It could be a cool project to have on your resume or talk about during an interview so I definitely to get it working for everybody. 

Following the debugging, we will do a brief Q&A and play a Kahoot game that will test your understanding of concepts used in our cyberbullying detection engine. This will be an opportunity for me to see where any confusion lies and hopefully clear up those concepts.

Finally, I've give a brief 'Intro to NLP' lesson for those who are interested. NLP and ML often work closely together to allow artificial intelligence to understand humans. We will be looking at how NLP could improve our cyberbullying detection engine.

## Debugging

While I help debug code for those of you who don't have it working, I want the people with working code to form group of 2-4 and collaboratively go over your code line by line, making sure each of you can explain precisely what each block of code does. If there is any code you don't understand, write it down and I'll go over it during the Q&A.

## Q&A

First I'll be going over any lines of code people aren't clear about, followed by answering any questions that were asked on Slack. We will also be playing a Kahoot game to test your understanding! 

## Intro to NLP

We will be going over some slides! They will be available here shortly.
